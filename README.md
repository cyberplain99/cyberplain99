## 📌 Featured Projects
Here are some of the security projects I’ve worked on:

### 🔍 Security Standards Documentation Project
[**NIST-Based Security Standards**](#) – As part of my role in GLS, I authored comprehensive Incident Management and Vulnerability Management standard documentation, aligning with NIST SP 800-series guidelines and the organization's overarching security strategy and policies. This initiative established a consistent and actionable framework for handling incidents and managing vulnerabilities across hybrid infrastructure, reinforcing regulatory compliance and operational resilience.

Key contributions:

Developed documentation grounded in NIST best practices and tailored to enterprise-specific threat models.

Ensured integration with existing security architecture and incident response workflows.

Drove alignment across security operations, compliance, and IT teams, enhancing cross-functional clarity and execution.

### 🛡️ Cloud Security Compliance Checker
[**Cloud-CIS-Benchmark**](#) – Terraform and Python-based tool for checking AWS/Azure/GCP configurations against CIS benchmarks.

### ⚡ Skybox Implementation
[**Skybox**](#) – Architected and implemented Skybox for a Canadian enterprise, integrating 100% of firewalls and enabling automated rule deployment via firewall assurance, network assurance, and change management modules — improving policy compliance and reducing manual change errors by 60%..

### 🧠 SOC AI Assistant
[**SOC-GPT**](#) – Custom GPT model integration for tier-1 SOC triage and enrichment, reducing MTTR by 50%.
